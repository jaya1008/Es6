        Constructing a promise
        It takes a function with two parameters,
         usually called resolve and reject.
          resolve is the function we will call when our promise is fulfilled,
           reject will be called when our promise is rejected.
Let's start with a function that returns a promise. This promise will always be fulfilled.
